## How to 

- Set in your email provider settings that all incoming Netflix mails go into a specific folder called "Netflix". If you want to use a different folder, you have to change the code.
- Set the envs
      - GMX_USERNAME=${GMX_USERNAME}
      - GMX_PASSWORD=${GMX_PASSWORD}
      - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
      - TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=${TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID}
      - SLEEP_TIME=${SLEEP_TIME:-30}
      
      (if you don't have gmx, you need to adjust the code)
      
      
- Run docker and have fun :)
